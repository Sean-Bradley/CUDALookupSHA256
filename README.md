# CUDALookupSHA256
SHA256 Lookup using parallel processing on a NVidia CUDA Compatible Graphics card

This is another experiment I did where i tried to generate many SHA256â€™s until I found a match.

This is a good way to learn about how SHA256 and CUDA work and not much else.

If you want to find a match for a pre computed sha256, you will still need many lifetimes and computing power if you were going to use this program.
